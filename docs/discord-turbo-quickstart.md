# Discord Turbo Quickstart

This doc is an **extremely** simplified guide to start your bot and connect it to Discord when testing locally

Shortest possible docs for the process:

1. Clone this repo
2. Rename the `creds.env.example` file to `creds.env`
3. Add your Discord bot token -> `CHAT_SERVICE_TOKEN='<value>'`
4. Run `make run` from the terminal
5. Invite your bot to your Discord server
6. ðŸš€
